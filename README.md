# Victoria-3
 None of the mods are necessarily balanced. Suggestions on balancing is appreciated. 

# Buildings Separated ('Base version')

 Creates industries that exclusively produce secondary goods (luxury goods) to allow for easier managing of industries through the buildings side-bar. Original industries unchanged in this version to allow for better compatibility with other mods. Intended to make managing industries easier for the player (the AI will still be able to build the new buildings, which could have unintended consequences.


# Industries Revamped ('Full version')

 Industries produce one goods and removes secondary output from original industries. Creates industries that exclusively produce secondary goods and the original factories now only produce one goods (Secondary goods and production chains removed), overwrites default industries. Shipyard excluded.

 Potentially game breaking (although in limited tests, thus far the AI builds the originals and the new industries and performs as well as it does in vanilla). Future evaluation and balacing to be expected.


# Half-sized Industries ('Alternative version')

 Same as the 'full version', but the industries are halved in sized, doubled in numbers.

 Industries now have half infrastructure cost, input and output, employment and construction cost etc. 


# Potential future projects.

# Resources separated (planned)
 Separate resource buildings.

 Hardwood logging camp, produces hardwood (might have to be combined with limits on where it can be built to match tropical wood from original victoria 2)

 Potatoes split from Rye Farm (might need potatoes as its own resource for it to make sense). 

 'Fruit Orchard' (As an alternative to Apple/Citrus/Fig Orchards) split from Rye/Maize/Wheat/Rice/Millet farms etc. (Creating one 'fruit orchard' instead of  three identical extra buildings that does the exact same thing) (might need some extra logic in regards to placement if it's done instead of three buildings that inherits the same logic as the building they're split from).

 Splitting off vineyard as a separate building (same placement rules as for Wheat farm?).
