# Victoria-3
Mods for Victoria 3

None of the mods are necessarily balanced.
Suggestions on balancing is appreciated. 

# Buildings separated
Future planned updates:

Fix images/icons for existing functions in the game (such as liquor factory having bakery icons) 

Fix images/icons that have the 'wrong' color compared to what is the norm in the game (silk/rayon in rayon plant being purple, instead of beige).

# Resources separated
Separate resource buildings - A logging camp that produces hardwood

Potatoes split from Rye Farm. 

Apple Orchards split from Rye farms etc.

# Potential future projects.
Potentially a separate mod that edits the existing buildings in the game and removes the secondary goods from them

Potentially game breaking with current AI behavior.

Would potentially have to change *a lot* of other files to make it work.
