# Victoria-3
Mods for Victoria 3

None of the mods are necessarily balanced.
Suggestions on balancing is appreciated. 

# Buildings separated

Creates industries that exclusively produce secondary goods (luxury goods) to allow for easier managing of industries through the buildings side-bar.


# Original industries separated

Original factories now only produce one goods (Secondary goods and production chains removed), overwrites default industries. Shipyard excluded. Has to be used together with 'Buildings separated'.

Potentially game breaking (although in limited tests, thus far the AI builds the originals and the new industries), has to be evaluated (AI behavior and other files might need to be changed).


# Half-sized industries

Combines the two mods above, but the industries are halved in sized, doubled in numbers.

Industries now have half infrastructure cost, input and output, employment and construction cost etc. 


# Potential future projects.

# Resources separated (planned)
Separate resource buildings.

Hardwood logging camp, produces hardwood (might have to be combined with limits on where it can be built to match tropical wood from original victoria 2)

Potatoes split from Rye Farm (might need potatoes as its own resource for it to make sense). 

'Fruit Orchard' (As an alternative to Apple/Citrus/Fig Orchards) split from Rye/Maize/Wheat/Rice/Millet farms etc. (Creating one 'fruit orchard' instead of  three identical extra buildings that does the exact same thing) (might need some extra logic in regards to placement if it's done instead of three buildings that inherits the same logic as the building they're split from).

Splitting off vineyard as a separate building (same placement rules as for Wheat farm?).
