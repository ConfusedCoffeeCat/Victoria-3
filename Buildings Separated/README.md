# Buildings Separated
Creates industries that exclusively produce secondary goods (luxury goods) to allow for easier managing of industries through the buildings side-bar, where all factories are more likely to be able to have the same production methods. No longer is adjusting individual factories for secondary goods required, instead more factories can be produced instead.

## Adds the following industries:

Liquor distillery (based on Food industry), produces Liquor.

Explosives Plant (based on Chemical plants), produces Explosives.

Luxury Textile Mill (based on Textile mill), produces Luxury Clothes.

Luxury Furniture Manufacturies (based on Furniture manufacturies), produces Luxury Furniture.

Porcelain Factory (based on Glassworks), produces Porcelain.

Automobile Industry (based on Motor industry), produces Automobiles.

Artillery Foundry (based on Arms industry), produces Artillery.

Rayon Plants, Synthetic silk production, (based on Synthetics plants), produces Silk.

Radio industry (based on Electrics industry), produces Radios.

Tank Industry (based on War machine industry), produces Tanks.

Steamer Shipyard (based on Shipyard), produces Steamers and Ironclads.


Currently not compatible with anything that changes the default meshes.
Would have to create a solution on how to add meshes without replacing default files in gfx\map\city_data\city_types


## Potential future updates:

Adjust input/output/employment for balancing purposes.

Consider the number of processes in each building for balancing purposes.
