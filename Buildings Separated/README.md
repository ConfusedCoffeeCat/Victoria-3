# Buildings Separated
Currently not compatible with anything that changes the default meshes.
Would have to create a solution on how to add meshes without replacing default files in gfx\map\city_data\city_types


## Future planned updates:

Fix images/icons for existing functions in the game (such as liquor factory having bakery icons) Fix images/icons that have the 'wrong' color compared to what is the norm in the game (silk/rayon in rayon plant being purple, instead of beige).
