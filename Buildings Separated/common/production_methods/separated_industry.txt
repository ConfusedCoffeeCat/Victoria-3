# MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES - Production Methods

# Third file
# Equivalent game file '\game\common\production_methods\01_industry.txt'

# Production methods in new production industries
# Calculated break-even points and adjusted input-outputs accordingly
# Base-value for goods from '\game\common\goods\00_goods.txt'
# Calculated according to 'base value' and theoretical profit in the base configuration.
# I.e. an explosive plant is going to, 'in theory', have about the same profitability as a chemical plant
# Theoretical profitability lowered (at least initally) for some factories/processes since it might be too
# much of an advantage being able to produce the goods directly

# Labor is currently, more or less, the same as the 'base' production for the building it is replacing.
# Ownership info split into a separate file 'separated_ownership'

# Future potential changes:
# Potentially lock certain combinations with 'unlocking_production_methods', see steamers for example.
