# Original buildings modified
Removes secondary output from industries. Has to be used together with 'Buildings Separated' to work. Overwrites default industries. 

Food industry no longer produces Liquor.

Chemical plants no longer produces Explosives.

Textile mill no longer produces Luxury Clothes.

Furniture manufacturies no longer produces Luxury Furniture.

Glassworks no longer produces Porcelain.

Motor industry no longer produces Automobiles.

Arms industry no longer produces Artillery.

Synthetics plants no longer produces Silk.

Electrics industry no longer produces Radios.

War machine industry no longer produces Tanks.

Shipyard - Unchanged.

## Potential future updates:

Adjust trade-routes that are now contain zero-goods, alternatively add/adjust buildings that produce the removed goods in associated provinces from where they were removed. (Fixed in Half-Sized Industries. Might do the same here, i.e. edit starting buildings /common/history/buildings/ )

Look at the ai programming in \common\ai_strategies regarding buildings and logic regarding buildings. Is outright removing the secondary goods from buildings an issue?

Consider adding back in a third process in some buildings where it was outright removed (for Original Buildings Modified), alternatively modifying the secondary goods in 'Buildings separated' to account for the current design. Might not be an issue.
