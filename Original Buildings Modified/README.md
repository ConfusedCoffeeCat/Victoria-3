# Original buildings modified
Has to be used together with Buildings Separated to work

Considerations to do:
Adjust trade-routes that are now zero worth, alternatively add/adjust buildings that produce the removed goods in associated provinces from where they were removed.

Look at the ai programming in \common\ai_strategies regarding buildings and logic regarding buildings. Is outright removing the secondary goods from buildings an issue?

Consider adding back in a third process in some buildings where it was outright removed (for Original Buildings Modified), alternatively modifying the secondary goods in Buildings separated to account for the current design. Might not be a big issue.
