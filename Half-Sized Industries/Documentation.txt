Created new building values in common\script_values.

Created new values in building_groups. Minor buff for light industries since they use 50 % of the previous infrastructure value (previous value = 2, new value = 1).
Compared to heavy industries which uses 67 % (previous value = 3, new value = 2).
Adjusted urbanization level to half the previous level.
Doubles the value of 'levels_per_mesh' to account that there's now going to be twice as many industries required to have the same output.

Halved input/output. Should be followed by a comment underneath the line regarding what has been adjusted.

Halved employment. Should be followed by a comment underneath the line regarding what has been adjusted.
Halved polution.

Went through \common\history\buildings and added secondary goods factories and doubled/adjusted  factory sizes where applicable.





Double buildings:
building_tooling_workshops
building_paper_mills
building_synthetics_plants
building_steel_mills 
building_motor_industry 
building_shipyards 
building_war_machine_industry 
building_electrics_industry 
building_munition_plants 

Add buildings on a ratio 1.5 to 0.5 for base goods vs. luxury goods.
Where the base goods is rounded up and the secondary goods is roudned down.
Example:
Value	Base	Luxury		Sum	
1		1			1 		2		(exception to the rule. Tend to go 1:1, instead of 2:0)
2		3			1		4
3		5			1		6
4		6			2		8
5		8			2		10
6		9			3		12


Search through the buildings to see which processes they have active, if it's a process for a luxury process, then it gets the associated buildings.

Number of separate instances of each building type (i.e. not including levels).
First go through any instances that doesn't require new specialty resource buildings. Double them straight up.

Questions
What impact does it have on the trade?

Editing \common\journal_entries to account for entries that otherwise won't work due to production methods having been removed.
Changes journal_entries to instead work with the new buildings / methods.
