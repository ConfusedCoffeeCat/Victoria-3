# Half-sized buildings
Industries now have half infrastructure cost, input and output, employment and construction cost etc.

Combination of Buildings separated and original buildings modified, where all industries are also now half-sized.

New industries that exclusively produce secondary goods (luxury goods) to allow for easier managing of industries through the buildings side-bar, where all factories are more likely to be able to have the same production methods. No longer is adjusting individual factories for secondary goods required, instead more factories can be produced instead. Also removes secondary output from industries (Overwrites default industries).

Adds and changes the following buildings:

The new Liquor distillery produces Liquor, and the Food industry no longer produces Liquor.

The new Explosives Plant produces Explosives, and the Chemical plants no longer produces Explosives.

The new Luxury Textile Mil produces Luxury Clothes, and the Textile mill no longer produces Luxury Clothes.

The new Luxury Furniture Manufacturies produces Luxury Furniture, and the Furniture manufacturies no longer produces Luxury Furniture.

The new Porcelain Factory produces Porcelain, and the Glassworks no longer produces Porcelain.

The new Automobile Industry produces Automobiles, and the Motor industry no longer produces Automobiles.

The new Artillery Foundry produces Artillery, and the Arms industry no longer produces Artillery.

The new Rayon Plants, Synthetic silk production, produces Silk, and the Synthetics plants no longer produces Silk.

The new Radio industry produces Radios, and the Electrics industry no longer produces Radios.

The new Tank Industry produces Tanks, and the War machine industry no longer produces Tanks.

The new Steamer Shipyard produces Steamers and Ironclads, but the shipyard remains unchanged.

## Notes and Potential future updates:

Evaluate if the AI performs better with smaller buildings when their decision making has smaller consequences for each decision. Faster feedback for each building.

Currently industries benefits more from throughput due to them being twice the level for the same output and cost (might consider adjusting throughput to take into account for higher levels of industries).

(Not going to change resource buildings since that would also require changing the size of all the regions on the map, it would have to be adjusted at the same time as a big resource overhaul mod).
